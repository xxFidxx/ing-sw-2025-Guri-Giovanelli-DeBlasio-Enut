This sequence illustrates the interactions between the client, server, controller, player, and spaceship when a player attempts to place a tile during their turn.

1) Client Initiates Tile Placement:
The Client sends a request to the Server to add a tile at position (xIndex, yIndex).

2) Server Forwards the Request:
The Server passes the request to the Controller, along with the listener reference.

3) Controller Gathers Necessary Data:

It asks the Player for the current tile in hand (getHandTile()), and the Player returns it.

Then it retrieves the SpaceshipPlance (the spaceship grid) from the Player.

4) Attempt to Place the Tile:
The Controller calls placeTileComponents(tile, xIndex, yIndex) on the SpaceshipPlance to attempt placing the tile.

5) Validation (Optional Outcomes):

If the tile position is outside the valid grid, SpaceshipPlance responds to the Client with "Outbound index".

If the tile position is already occupied, it sends "Already busy spot".

Otherwise, it checks if the tile is well connected by invoking checkNewTile(x, y) on the ComponentTile, and updates connectivity.

6) Update Internal Structures:
The Controller requests from SpaceshipPlance:

The current reserve spot (getReserveSpot)

The current tile-to-grid mapping (getTileToGrid)
The SpaceshipPlance returns the respective values.

7) Notify the Client to Update the View:
The Controller triggers the event SHOW_SHIP via listener.onEvent(SHOW_SHIP).
The Server then tells the Client to update the view with showUpdate(SHOW_SHIP).

8) Sends the Client to the next state:
The Controller triggers the ASSEMBLY event to continue the assembly phase → showUpdate(ASSEMBLY) is sent to the Client.
