Sequence Diagram Description – "Access to the Game"
This sequence diagram represents the process of a client accessing or creating a game lobby in a multiplayer system. The interaction involves four main components:

Client

Server


1. Creating the Lobby
The Client sends a createLobby(size) request to the Server.

The Server forwards this request as createLobby(number) to the Controller.

Conditional Check 1: [lobby != null]
If a lobby is already created (lobby != null), the Server returns the message "lobby is already set" to the Client.

Otherwise, the system transitions into the LOBBY_PHASE:

The Server notifies the listener: listener.OnEvent(LOBBY_PHASE)

The Client updates its view: showUpdate(LOBBY_PHASE)

2. Adding a Nickname
The Client sends a nickname via addNickname(client, input) to the Server.

Conditional Check 2: [realClients.size() < lobbySize]
If there is room in the lobby:

The Server adds the client to the list: realClients.add(Client)

Then it invokes addNickname(ClientListenerRmi, nickname) on the Controller

The Controller forwards this to the Lobby: setPlayersNicknames(nickname)

3. Game Initialization or Waiting
Conditional Check 3: [lobby.isFull()]
If the lobby is full:

The Controller initializes the game using: gameInit()

The Server notifies: listener.OnEvent(GAME_INIT)

The Client updates: showUpdate(GAME_INIT)

Otherwise:

The Server triggers: listener.OnEvent(WAIT_LOBBY)

The Client updates: showUpdate(WAIT_LOBBY)
